<h4 data-number="1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-game"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> The Game</h4>
<p>Counter-Strike 2 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. In 2012, with the release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the game became hugely popular largely due to the <strong>competitive mode</strong> and the introduction of <strong>skins (gambling related)</strong>.</p>
<p>The game pits two teams against each other: the <strong>Terrorist (T)</strong> against the <strong>Counter Terrorist (CT)</strong>. Each team has 5 players, with a total of 10 players in a match. At the start, the teams are given the roles of T or CT. In the round 13 this roles are swapped.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-rules" class="level4" data-number="1.1.2">
<h4 data-number="1.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-rules"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> The Rules</h4>
<p>A competitive match of CS2 is played in a maximum of 24 <strong>rounds of 2 minutes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The winner:</strong> First team to win 13 rounds wins the match.</li>
<li><strong>Tie:</strong> It is possible to end the match in a Tie if both teams reach 12 rounds.</li>
<li><strong>Surrender:</strong> If a team mate leaves of the match is very unequal and a team see that losing is unavoidable, they can vote to surrender to save time.</li>
</ul>

<section id="the-round" class="level4" data-number="1.1.3">
<h4 data-number="1.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-round"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> The Round</h4>
<p>Each round is started in the same way. Both teams player’s appear in their base, and have 15 seconds before they can move and start the round to prepare and choose their equipment.</p>
<p>To win a round there are 2 possible ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kill all (5) players on the other team.</li>
<li><strong>Terrorists:</strong> Plant the bomb and explode it.</li>
<li><strong>Counter Terrorist:</strong> Defuse the bomb after is set.</li>
</ul>

<h4 data-number="1.1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="map"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Map</h4>
<p>Every map is designed in a similar way. The CT appear near the designated areas where the bomb must be planted. The T appears in the opposite end of the map. The maps then have different paths and features, but in general they have 3 main paths to reach the bomb site: A, B and Middle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A:</strong> The path that leads to bomb site “A”.</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> The path that leads to bomb site “B”.</li>
<li><strong>Middle:</strong> The path that leads to the middle of the map. It is usually more dangerous and leads between the two bomb sites.</li>

Why CS2 is different from other Esports
</summary>
<p>Counter Strike 2 might look simple on a first impression, but under the hood, it is a very complex game, with a huge amount of systems to keep in mind that can tilt the game in favour of the most prepared team.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="money"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Money</h4>
<p>Money is a key element of CS2, as it is used to buy weapons, armor, and grenades. Managing money is crucial to winning the game, as it can give a team a significant advantage over the other team. The amount of money a team has will determine what weapons they can buy, and how many grenades they can afford.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each round, each team member is awarded an amount of money. The amount will differ depending on the outcome of the previous round. Furthermore, if a team wins a round, they will receive more money than the losing team, but to keep the game balanced, the losing team will receive a higher amount of money the more rounds they lose in a row.</p>
<p>Also, bonus money is awarded for completing objectives, such as planting the bomb, defusing the bomb, or killing the enemy team.</p>
<p>Killing an enemy player will also reward the player with money, but the amount will depend on the weapon used to kill the enemy.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="weapons"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Weapons</h4>
<p>There are a variety of weapons in CS2, each with its own unique characteristics. Some weapons are more powerful than others, but they are also more expensive. The most powerful weapons are the AWP and the AK-47, but they are also the most expensive. The AWP is a one-shot kill weapon, while the AK-47 is a one-shot kill weapon to the head.</p>
<p>Generally, the weapons can be divided into three categories:</p>

<p>Armor is an essential part of CS2, as it can protect the player from damage. There are two types of armor in CS2:</p>

<p>Armor can be bought at the beginning of each round, and it will protect the player from damage until it is depleted. Once the armor is depleted, the player will take full damage from any subsequent hits.</p>
<p>The helmet is an optional purchase after buying Kevlar. It is recommended to buy a helmet if the enemy team is using rifles, as it will protect the player from a one-shot kill to the head.</p>

<p>This roles are not enforced, but they are a good way to understand the game and the different ways to play it. Even non professional players tend to follow this roles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In CS2, each player has a specific role to play. There are five main roles in CS2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry Fragger:</strong> The player who goes in first and tries to get the first kill.</li>
<li><strong>Lurker:</strong> The player who stays behind and tries to catch the enemy team off guard.</li>
<li><strong>AWPer:</strong> The player who uses the AWP sniper rifle to get kills from long range.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> The player who helps the team by throwing grenades and providing cover fire.</li>
<li><strong>In-Game Leader:</strong> The player who calls the shots and makes the decisions for the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>This roles are chosed individually by each player depending on their own skills and how they play best, and it is important for the team to work together and communicate effectively in order to win the game.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.2.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="randomness"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span> Randomness</h4>
<p>CS2 is a game of skill, but there is also an element of randomness to it. The outcome of a round can be influenced by many factors, such as the weapons used, the map, the strategy, and the luck of the players. This randomness is what makes CS2 so exciting to watch and play, as it keeps the game fresh and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Each round is virtually unique, completely different from the previous one, and the outcome is never certain. The tide of the game can turn in an instant, and a team that is losing can quickly turn the game around and win the match.</p>
<p>No player faces the same situation twice, and each round is a new challenge that requires quick thinking, fast reflexes, and teamwork to overcome.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.2.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.7</span> Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Adding the economic system, the weapons, the grenades, the armor, the maps, the strategies, the roles, and the randomness, CS2 is a complex game that requires a lot of skill and practice to master, but it is also a game that is incredibly rewarding and fun to play.</p>
<p>The final touch is the competitive mode, where players can play against other players of similar skill level, and climb the ranks to become the best player in the world. This mode is what makes CS2 so popular, as it gives players a sense of accomplishment and progression, and keeps them coming back for more. While in other modes or other games, the player can play for fun but there is no real objective, in competitive mode the player has a goal, to win and climb the ranks, and this is what makes CS2 so addictive and engaging.</p>

<p>Weapon selection in CS2 are slightly different from Terrorist to Counter Terrorist.</p>
<p>Weapons like AK-47, Glock-18 or SG 553 are T only, while M4A1-S, AUG or USP-S are CT only</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This means that for AK-47 to have so many kills, knowing that in a match half of the players are CT and half T, even the CT will pick up and use an AK-47 and use it if the have the chance, making it the most popular weapon on the game.</p>

<p>The figure above shows the average kills per round with each weapon. Here we can already start to think about <strong>effectiveness</strong> of a weapon (in the hands of the correct player).</p>
<p>In average, a player with a G3SG1 will kill 1.9 enemies, with AWP 1.6, AUG 1.3 and AK-47 1.2. This decimal numbers can be described as percentage of health of an enemy, so 1.9 is one kill and 90% of health of another player (or distributed among other players).</p>

<p>We can see that <strong>accuracy</strong> totals around 90% for all weapons, but when we look at the individual parts, these are not distributed equally.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Headshots:</strong> Desert Eagle is the weapon with the highest headshot percentage, followed by USP-S and Famas. USP-S is a CT only weapon and it is given at the start of the round, so most CT players have it most of the time. Desert Eagle, on the other hand, is the most expensive pistol in the game, so it is used by players that are confident in their aim.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chest:</strong>Numbers are more evenly distributed around 60%, nevertheless, the AWP has the highest percentage, followed by 5 pistols. AWP is because is a one hit kill weapon, so players aim for the chest to guarantee the kill. For the pistols, they are used in close range where enemies are moving, so it is harder to aim for the head.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leg:</strong> Numbers are similar to Headshots. Here we can see that the weapons with the highest leg percentage are SMGs and shotguns. These weapons are used in close range, where it is easier to hit the legs of the enemy. Also the spray pattern of these weapons is more random, so they tend to be aimed lower.</p></li>

<p>In the pie chart above we can see the play rate of each map. Dust II is the most popular map, followed by Mirage and Inferno.</p>
<p>Dust II is the most popular map in Counter Strike history, it is a simple map with 2 bomb sites and 3 main paths to reach them. It is a map that is easy to learn and play, so it is the most played map in the game.</p>
<p>This 3 maps compute more than 50% of the total play rate, so they are the most played maps in the game. The reason goes in 2 ways, they are the most played in the competitive scene and tournaments, so players want to practice them. Also, they are the most played in the casual scene, so players are more familiar with them. Which scene is the cause of this is hard to know, but it is a feedback loop that makes them the most played maps.</p>

<p>In the bar chart above we can see the win percentage of each side by map. The win rate is close to 50% for most maps, with the exception of Italy, with a unbalance of almost 16% in favor of the CT side.</p>
<p>We also can see that the most played maps (Dust II, Mirage and Inferno) have a win rate close to 50%, so they are balanced maps. This is important in a competitive game, as it makes the game fair for both teams. This also matches with Italy, the most unbalanced map, being the least played map.</p>
<p>The game also feeds back on this, as now maps are bundled in map packages, so players can choose to play one package, usually being the competitive one with the most balanced maps and the other packages with the less popular maps as shown in the chart.</p>

<p>In this section we will analyze the top players by wins, losses and ties. The complete formula for how CS rates players is not public, but it is known that it takes into account the player’s performance in the game, the player’s team performance, and the player’s opponents’ performance, as well as the win or lose of the match. That means that even if the match is a tie or a loss, the player can still have a good CS rating if they performed well in the game.</p>
<p>Other miscellaneous things are taken into account, suck as the rank of other players, or if a player leaves the match giving disadvantage to a team or if a player flagged as a cheater.</p>

<pre><code>The correlation between Wins and Losses is [  0.57897954 -20.36887699], </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The scatter plot above shows the top players by wins and losses. The regression line shows a positive correlation between wins and losses, meaning that players with more wins tend to have more losses. This is expected, as the more games a player plays, the more likely they are to win and lose games. Also, the more wins a player has, the more likely they are to be matched against better players, increasing the chances of losing games.</p>
<p>The result <code>[0.57897954, -20.36887699]</code> from the <code>np.polyfit</code> function represents a linear relationship between wins and losses for the top players:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slope (0.579)</strong>: For each additional win, losses are predicted to increase by approximately 0.579. This suggests a moderately positive correlation between wins and losses, meaning as players win more, they tend to accumulate more losses as well.</li>
<li><strong>Intercept (-20.37)</strong>: The model predicts about -20 losses when the number of wins is zero. While this doesn’t make sense practically, it helps define the linear trend.</li>
</ul>
<p>The equation of the line would be: <span class="math display">\[ \text{Losses} = 0.579 \times \text{Wins} - 20.37 \]</span></p>
<p>In summary, the model indicates that as a player’s number of wins increases, so do their losses at a fairly consistent rate.</p>

<p>The cluster map above shows the top players by wins and losses, clustered into three groups. The clusters are based on the players’ performance in terms of wins and losses. The clustering algorithm groups players with similar win and loss patterns together, providing insights into player performance and behavior.</p>
<p>This 3 groups could be interpreted as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster 0 (Blue)</strong>: Players with low wins and almost 0 losses. These players are natural talents or experienced players with a new account. Probably play on a team of 5 players and have a good team.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 1 (Green)</strong>: Players with a balanced number of wins and losses. These players are consistent performers who win and lose games at a similar rate. Likely play solo or with a team of 2 or 3 players.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 2 (Red)</strong>: Players with high wins and losses. These players are high-risk, high-reward players who play a lot and prioritize quantity over quality. Probably play solo a lot even if they have a team.</li>

<p>Here we can see the age distribution of professional players. The majority of players are in their mid-20s, with the peak age being around 24-25 years old. This is expected, as players in their mid-20s are typically at their peak performance in terms of reaction time and skill level.</p>
<p>The distribution is slightly skewed to the right, with fewer players in their early 20s and stopping abruptly at the age of 17. This could be due to the age restrictions in professional CS:GO tournaments, where players under the age of 18 are not allowed to compete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are slightly more players in their late 20s and early 30s, which could be due to the experience and maturity that comes with age. These players may have been playing CS:GO for a longer time and have more experience in competitive play.</p>

<p>Here we have an interactive map of the count of professional players by country. The map shows the distribution of professional players around the world, with the United States, Russia, Sweden, Poland, Brazil and Australia being the countries with the most professional players. Keeping in mind the total population, is remarkable how many players Sweden and Poland have in the professional scene.</p>

<pre><code>The correlation between Total Kills and Total Deaths is [  0.91452994 719.36367559],

</div>
</div>
<p>The scatter plot above shows the key player metrics of total kills and total deaths. The regression line shows a positive correlation between total kills and total deaths, meaning that players with more kills tend to have more deaths. This is expected, as the more kills a player gets, the more likely they are to die in the game.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can see a well defined line, meaning that the ratio of kills to deaths is consistent across all players in the professional scene. This is important, as it shows that players are playing at a similar level and are evenly matched in terms of skill and performance.</p>
<p>It could also infer that for a casual player to become a professional player, they need to have a good kill-death ratio, around <strong>1.04</strong>. Still other skills including team play, communication, strategy and experience are needed to become a professional player.</p>

Why Headshots?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Headshots are important in CS2 because they deal more damage than body shots, and they are more likely to kill the enemy in one shot. This is important in a game where every shot counts, and players need to be accurate and precise to win.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The scatter plot above shows the headshot percentage and kill-death ratio of professional players. The headshot percentage is the percentage of kills that are headshots, while the kill-death ratio is the total number of kills divided by the total number of deaths.</p>
<p>The regression line shows a small negative correlation between headshot percentage and kill-death ratio, meaning that players with a higher headshot percentage tend to have a lower kill-death ratio. This is expected, as players who go for headshots are more likely to miss shots and die more often.</p>

<p>Not only that, but sniper rifles inflict the highest damage, and kill in 2 shots to the body. Specially the AWP, which is a one shot kill weapon, players can then aim for any part of the body to kill the enemy, so aiming for the head, which is a smaller target and could be missed is not the best strategy. This could mean that most sniper players, which also tend to play more defensively and from distance, could have a higher kill-death ratio and a lower headshot percentage, while players that play more aggressively and with rifles could have a higher headshot percentage and a lower kill-death ratio.</p>

<p>In the bar chart above we can see the distribution of professional players by team. The second done is zoomed in the top 10 teams. This includes from the current and previous teams of the players, this way it shows a broader view of which teams have more movement of players.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we can see if this teams are the most successful in the professional scene, meaning that their movement in players is motivated by the improvement of the team, or on the other hand, if the movement is due to the team not being successful and players leaving to find a better team.</p>

<p>The interactive plot above lets you explore the win percentage of professional teams over time. You can select a team from the dropdown menu to see how their win percentage has changed over the years. The plot shows the win percentage for each month of the year, allowing you to see trends and patterns in the team’s performance.</p>
<p>For most teams, the win percentage is mostly stable over time, with some fluctuations depending on the year. This could be due to changes in the team roster, coaching staff, or other factors that affect team performance. Some teams show a clear upward or downward trend in their win percentage, indicating a change in performance over time.</p>

<p>Here we can see the total rounds played in professional matches over time. The number of rounds played in a match can vary depending on the format of the match (best of 1, best of 3, etc.) and the skill level of the teams. The average number of rounds played in a professional match is around 25-30, with some matches going up to 40 rounds or more.</p>
<p>Some might be exceptionally short if one team dominates the other or unexpected events happen, like a player disconnecting or a team forfeiting the match.</p>

<p>This plot shows the average multikill percentage of professional players over time. The multikill percentage is the percentage of rounds where a player gets two or more kills. The average multikill percentage is around 17%, meaning that players get two or more kills in about 1 out of 5 rounds. This also means that basically every round, there is a chance that atleast one of the team members makes a multi kill. This is an important metric in CS:GO, as multikills can swing the momentum of a game and give a team a significant advantage.</p>

<p>VAC is an anti-cheat software developed by Valve Corporation. It is used in games like Counter-Strike to detect and ban players who are using cheats or hacks to gain an unfair advantage. VAC works by scanning a player’s computer for known cheat software and banning them if any is found.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, VAC is not perfect and there are ways to bypass it. Some cheats are designed to be undetectable by VAC. It is an arms race between cheat developers and anti-cheat software developers, with each side trying to outsmart the other.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simple-understanding-of-cheating"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Simple Understanding of Cheating</h3>
<p>Cheating in Counter-Strike can take many forms, from aimbots that automatically aim at enemies to wallhacks that allow players to see through walls. Other cheats include triggerbots that automatically shoot when an enemy is in the crosshair, and bunnyhopping scripts that allow players to move faster than normal.</p>
<p>All of this is possible because the game has the information about all players, including their position, health, and weapons, on the client side. This means that players can modify the game files to gain an advantage over others. It is just a matter of time until a cheat developer finds a way to use this data to create a cheat that is undetectable by VAC. Then, it is up to VAC to detect and ban these cheat software and players using it.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-of-cheating"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Impact of Cheating</h3>
<p>Cheating in Counter-Strike has a negative impact on the game and the community. It ruins the competitive integrity of the game, making it unfair for players who are playing legitimately. It also creates a toxic environment where players are constantly accusing each other of cheating and reporting suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>The game implements a voting system where players can vote to kick a player from the game if they suspect them of cheating. This is a way for the community to police itself and remove cheaters from the game. However, this system is not foolproof and can be abused by players who want to kick others for no reason.</p>
<p>Also it features a report system, where players can report other players for cheating, griefing, or other violations of the game’s rules. This system is used to gather data on suspicious players and take action against them if necessary. If enough reports are received, the player will be investigated and banned if found to be cheating or acting inappropriately.</p>
